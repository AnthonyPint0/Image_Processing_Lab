# CADE 8P425: Image Processing Lab

## 1. Image Representation and Basic Operations
Read, display, and save images; perform pixel-level operations, resizing, rotation, and transformations using Python.

## 2. Gray-Level Transformations
Implement contrast stretching, logarithmic, power-law, and negative transformations on images.

## 3. Image Quantization
Simulate image quantization by reducing bits per pixel and analyze visual degradation using Python.

## 4. Spatial Domain Filtering
Apply smoothing filters (mean, median, Gaussian) and sharpening filters (Laplacian, high-pass) for noise reduction and enhancement.

## 5. Frequency Domain Filtering
Perform Fourier Transform and Inverse Fourier Transform; apply homomorphic filtering to correct uneven lighting and enhance contrast.

## 6. Image Restoration
Simulate image degradation (motion blur, Gaussian noise) and restore images using Wiener filtering and inverse filtering techniques.

## 7. Edge Detection
Implement edge detection algorithms like Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts, and Canny.

## 8. Thresholding for Image Segmentation
Perform global thresholding (Otsu’s method) and adaptive thresholding for segmenting images.

## 9. Region-Based Segmentation
Implement region-growing and splitting-merging algorithms for image segmentation.

## 10. Feature Extraction
Extract features using GLCM and SIFT methods with OpenCV.

## 11. Classification Techniques
Implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for image classification and evaluation performance.

## 12. Bayesian Classifier and Performance Evaluation
Implement a Bayesian classifier and evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 13. Clustering Algorithms
Apply unsupervised clustering algorithms like K-Means and hierarchical clustering for segmenting image data.

## 14. Applications of Pattern Recognition
Implement real-world applications like OCR, face recognition, or object detection and localization using Haar cascades or pre-trained models.

## 15. Fuzzy Logic for Pattern Recognition
Implement fuzzy classification where objects can belong to multiple classes with varying degrees of membership.

## 16. Noise Removal and Image Enhancement
Apply noise removal techniques like Gaussian, median, and bilateral filters to enhance image quality.
